== Instruction ==
You can open the ipython notebook to see all my code and 
intermediate result and plots.

If you want to run the script, you can open Part1/ex2.py and 
Part1/ex2_reg.py and just run the script for seeing all the result 
including plots for part1

As for part2, you can open Part2/mini_batch_ex2_reg.py and run 
the script for seeing all the result including plots for part2

Due to inable to import joblib from script, you can only see the 
response to part3 in Homework2.ipynb
