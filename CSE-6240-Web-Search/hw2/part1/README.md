> Part 1 is for implementing logistic regression using python.

The implementation of logistic regression is in logisticRegression.py.
ex2.py shows an example of linear separable case
ex2_reg.py shows an example of non-linear separable case and uses polynormial feature transformation
to embed the features in higher dimension.
